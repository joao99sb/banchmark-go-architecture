 ‚úîÔ∏è Benchmarking Architectural Performance in Go ‚úîÔ∏è
</h1>

## üíª About the Project

‚ôªÔ∏è This repository contains the benchmarking code used to evaluate different processing architectures in Go, specifically focusing on image processing tasks such as resizing and grayscaling. The primary goal of this benchmark is to measure and compare the processing times across three distinct architectures: a pipeline architecture, sequential processing without a pipeline, and parallel processing without a pipeline.

## Running the Benchmark

To run the benchmark, ensure you have Go installed on your system and follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/joao99sb/banchmark-go-architecture

# Go into the repository
$ cd banchmark-go-architecture

# Build the binary
$ make

# Run the benchmark
$ ./main
```

The application will display the results directly in the terminal
